WebApp-WebAPI-OAuth2-AppIdentity-DotNet
=======================================

In contrast to the WebApp-WebAPI-OpenIDConnect-DotNet sample, this sample shows how to build an MVC web application that uses Azure AD for sign-in using OpenID Connect, and then calls a web API under the application's identity (instead of the user's identity) using tokens obtained via OAuth 2.0. This sample uses the OpenID Connect ASP.Net OWIN middleware and ADAL .Net.
